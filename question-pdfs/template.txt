1. If x² + 5x + 6 = 0, what are the values of x?
A) x = -2, -3
B) x = 2, 3
C) x = -1, -6
D) x = 1, 6
Answer: A
Explanation: Using factorization: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0, Therefore, x = -2 or x = -3

2. What is the area of a circle with radius 5 units?
A) 25π square units
B) 10π square units
C) 15π square units
D) 20π square units
Answer: A
Explanation: Area of a circle = πr², Where r = 5, Therefore, Area = π(5)² = 25π square units

3. What is the value of sin²θ + cos²θ?
A) 0
B) 1
C) 2
D) Depends on θ
Answer: B
